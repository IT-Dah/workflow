An assignment delivery full of issues.

I have tried and failed so many times. Im not sure what im doing when it comes to GitHub, and i really struggle with reading through the modules on mollify. 
I made multiple branches, failed, and ended up making new branches, to get a fresh start. I believe that has caused some issues for me, among other things.

At the end i paniced and was using ChatGPT to help me figure out what i was doing wrong. Unfortenatly it didnt help much.

I am sorry for the chaos. I really did my best.
